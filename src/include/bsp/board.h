/* This header file contains function prototypes for the interfaces between
 * (1) the nuttx core-code, (2) the microprocessor specific logic that
 * resides under the arch/ sub-directory, and (3) the board-specific logic
 * that resides under configs/
 *
 * Naming conventions:
 *
 * 1. Common Microprocessor Interfaces.
 *
 *    Any interface that is common across all microprocessors should be
 *    prefixed with up_ and prototyped in this header file. These
 *    definitions provide the common interface between NuttX and the
 *    architecture-specific implementation in arch/
 *
 *    These definitions are retained in the the header file nuttx/include/arch.h
 *
 *    NOTE: up_ is supposed to stand for microprocessor; the u is like the
 *    Greek letter micron: µ. So it would be µP which is a common shortening
 *    of the word microprocessor.
 *
 * 2. Microprocessor-Specific Interfaces.
 *
 *    An interface which is unique to a certain microprocessor should be
 *    prefixed with the name of the microprocessor, for example stm32_,
 *    and be prototyped in some header file in the arch/ directories.
 *
 *    There is also a arch/<architecture>/include/<chip>/chip.h header file
 *    that can be used to communicate other microprocessor-specific
 *    information between the board logic and even application logic.
 *    Application logic may, for example, need to know specific capabilities
 *    of the chip.  Prototypes in that chip.h header file should follow the
 *    microprocessor specific naming convention.
 *
 * 3. Common Board Interfaces.
 *
 *    Any interface that is common across all boards should be prefixed
 *    with board_ and should be prototyped in this header file. These
 *    board_ definitions provide the interface between the board-level
 *    logic and the architecture-specific logic.
 *
 *    Board related declarations are retained in this header file.
 *
 *    There is also a configs/<board>/include/board.h header file that
 *    can be used to communicate other board-specific information between
 *    the architecture logic and even application logic.  Any definitions
 *    which are common between a single architecture and several boards
 *    should go in this board.h header file; this file is reserved for
 *    board-related definitions common to all architectures.
 *
 * 4. Board-Specific Interfaces.
 *
 *    Any interface which is unique to a board should be prefixed with
 *    the board name, for example stm32f4discovery_. Sometimes the board
 *    name is too long so stm32_ would be okay too. These should be
 *    prototyped in configs/<board>/src/<board>.h and should not be used
 *    outside of that board directory since board-specific definitions
 *    have no meaning outside of the board directory.

 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   status - Status information provided with the reset event.  This
 *     meaning of this status information is board-specific.  If not used by
 *     a board, the value zero may be provided in calls to board_reset.
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   If this function returns, then it was not possible to power-off the
 *   board due to some constraints.  The return value int this case is a
 *   board-specific reason for the failure to shutdown.

 * Description:
 *   This functions is called very early in initialization to perform board-
 *   specific initialization of LED-related resources.  This includes such
 *   things as, for example, configure GPIO pins to drive the LEDs and also
 *   putting the LEDs in their correct initial state.
 *
 *   NOTE: In most architectures, board_led_initialize() is called from
 *   board-specific initialization logic.  But there are a few architectures
 *   where this initialization function is still called from common chip
 *   architecture logic.  This interface is not, however, a common board
 *   interface in any event and, hence, the usage of the name
 *   board_led_initialize is deprecated.
 *
 *   WARNING: This interface name will eventually be removed; do not use it
 *   in new board ports.  New implementations should use the naming
 *   conventions for "Microprocessor-Specific Interfaces" or the "Board-
 *   Specific Interfaces" as described above.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *   None
 *
 * Returned Value:
